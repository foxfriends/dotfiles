# Bash setup

Instructions:
1.  Symlink `.bashrc` to the `$HOME` directory
2.  Run `.init` to install dependencies (probably requires sudo)
3.  Restart shell to enjoy

Any files in this directory will be sourced as the final step of the main .bashrc setup. Hidden files
will not be run (that's why this is .readme.md)
