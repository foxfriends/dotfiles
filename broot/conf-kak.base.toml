###############################################################
# Default flags
# You can set up flags you want broot to start with by
# default, for example `default_flags="ihp"` if you usually want
# to see hidden and gitignored files and the permissions (then
# if you don't want the hidden files you can launch `br -H`)
# A popular flag is the `g` one which displays git related info.
#
default_flags = "g"

###############################################################
# Special paths
# If some paths must be handled specially, uncomment (and change
# this section as per the examples
#
# [special-paths]
# "/media/slow-backup-disk" = "no-enter"
# "/home/dys/useless" = "hide"
# "/home/dys/my-link-I-want-to-explore" = "enter"

###############################################################
# Date/Time format
# If you want to change the format for date/time, uncomment the
# following line and change it according to
# https://docs.rs/chrono/0.4.11/chrono/format/strftime/index.html
#
# date_time_format = "%Y/%m/%d %R"

###############################################################
# Whether to mark the selected line with a triangle
#
# show_selection_mark = true

###############################################################
# Column order
# cols_order, if specified, must be a permutation of the following
# array. You should keep the name at the end as it has a variable
# length.
#
# cols_order = [
# 	"mark",
# 	"git",
# 	"branch",
# 	"permission",
# 	"date",

###############################################################
# True Colors
# If this parameter isn't set, broot tries to automatically
# determine whether true colors (24 bits) are available.
# As this process is unreliable, you may uncomment this setting
# and set it to false or true if you notice the colors in
# previewed images are too off.

###############################################################
# Verbs and shortcuts
# You can define your own commands which would be applied to
# the selection.

# [[verbs]]
# name = "tail_lines"
# invocation = "tl {lines_count}"

# If $EDITOR isn't set on your computer, you should either set it using
#  something similar to
#   export EDITOR=nvim #  or just replace it with your editor of choice in the 'execution'
#  pattern.
#  If your editor is able to open a file on a specific line, use {line}
#   so that you may jump directly at the right line from a preview.
# Example:
#  execution = "nvim +{line} {file}"
